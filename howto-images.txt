we are no longer using data.csv for cover art or the screenshots



To add cover art:

create folder in images/cover-art with name of the game's ID number as listed in data.csv

ex. images/cover-art/2

add image to said folder




To add images for the screenshot slider:

create folder in images/screenshots with name of the game's ID number as listed in data.csv

ex. images/screenshots/2

add images to said folder (only use images 1280 x 720)



note: You need to use an ssh client (putty) to delete any images you
upload and no longer want to use, so be careful. I can show you how
to if you need help. If you use the same filename it will overwrite 
and you will be fine.
